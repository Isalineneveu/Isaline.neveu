<h3>THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL.</h3>


<div class="text-content">

    <p> A Fox being caught in a trap, escaped after much difficulty with the
      loss of his tail.He was, however, a good deal ashamed of appearing in
      public without this ornament, and at last, to avoid being singular and
      ridiculous in the eyes of his own species, he formed the project of
      calling together an assembly of Foxes, and of persuading them that the
      docking of their tails was a fashion that would be very agreeable and
      becoming. </p>

      <p>Accordingly he made a long harangue to them for that purpose,
      and endeavoured chiefly to shew the awkwardness and inconvenience of a
      Foxâ€™s tail, adding that they were quite useless, and that they would be
      a very great deal better without them. He asserted, that what he had
      only conjectured and imagined before, he now found by experience to be
      true, for he never enjoyed himself so much, and found himself so easy
      as he had done since he cut off his tail. </p>

      <p>He then looked round with a brisk air, to see what proselytes he had gained; when a sly old Fox
      in company answered him, with a leer: </p>


      <p class="morale"> I believe you may have found a
      convenience in parting with your tail, and perhaps when we are in the
      same circumstances, we may do so too.</p>

      <h3>  THE DOG AND THE SHADOW. </h3>

      </div>

<div class="text2">

      <p> A Dog, crossing a rivulet with a piece of flesh in his mouth, saw his
      own shadow represented in the clear mirror of the stream; and believing
      it to be another Dog, who was carrying another piece of flesh, he could
      not forbear catching at it; but was so far from getting any thing by
      his greedy design, that he dropt the piece he had in his mouth, which
      immediately sunk to the bottom, and was irrecoverably lost.</p>

      <h3>  THE PROUD FROG AND THE OX. </h3>
<div class="text3">

<p>An Ox, grazing in a meadow, chanced to set his foot among a parcel of
young Frogs, and trod one of them to death. The rest informed their
mother, when she came home, what had happened; telling her, that the
beast which did it, was the hugest creature that they ever saw in their
lives.</p>

<p class="morale"> What, was it so big? says the old Frog, swelling and blowing up
her speckled belly to a great degree. Oh! bigger by a vast deal, say
they: and so big? says she, straining herself yet more. Indeed, say
they, if you were to burst yourself, you would never be so big. She
strove yet again, and burst herself indeed.</p>
